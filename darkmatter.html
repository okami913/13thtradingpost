         <b>**How to Prepare Dark Matter Metacine**</b>
         <br>
1.Empty package into a large pot with 6 cups of room temperature or cold water.
<br>
2.Allow to soak for 15 min.
<br>
3.Bring mixture to a boil.
<br> 
4.Reduce temperature if needed, but allow to boil for 45 minutes uncovered. It should be bubbling for the entire 45 minutes. Stir often.
<br>
5.If using a simple syrup as a sweetener, prepare that according to instructions.
<br>
6.After 45 minutes, the elderberry mixture should be greatly reduced. Remove from heat and allow to cool till it is safe to handle.
<br>
7.Strain about the liquid using cheesecloth or a fine mesh sifter. Squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Take you time with this step.
<br>
8.Measure the remainder of the elderberry liquid, you should have 2 cups. If you have less than two cups, add water to bring the measurement to 2 cups. If you have more than 2 cups, you can boil the liquid longer until it reduces to 2 cups (this step is important to achieve a more accurate dose concentration)
<br>
9.Combine elderberry mixture with 1 cup of the sweetener of your choice in a glass container. If using honey as a sweetener, be sure to add the honey once the elderberry has cooled down enough (think a cup of tea that is warm enough to sip and not burn your tongue) or else the excessive heat will destroy the medicinal properties of the honey. If using simple syrup, it can be added straight away. Stevia is an option but not recommended, it tastes awful with elderberry syrup. You have been warned.
<br>
10.Elderberry pulp may be composted. If you do not compost, you can bury the pulp and the earthworms will be grateful.
<br>
11.Label the jar with the date of preparation. Elderberry can last up to 3 months in the fridge.
